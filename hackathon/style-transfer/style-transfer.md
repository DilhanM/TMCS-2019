# Style transfer using neural networks
Objective of this project is to build an algorithm based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) paper by Gatys et.al. which can be used to apply the style of one image to the content of another.
GPUs are much faster at image processing than CPUs so you'll be writing the code in a Colab notebook which lets you use Google's GPUs (or even TPUs) for free.
